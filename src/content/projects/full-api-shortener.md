The application hosted at <a href="https://mugiurl.netlify.app/" target="blank" class="hover:text-[var(--accent)] underline">**this website**</a> is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the shortening of URLs. Developed using the Vite build tool in conjunction with the React JavaScript library, the application offers a streamlined and efficient user experience for generating compact, shareable links.​

**Key Features**

 *User-Friendly Interface:* The application presents a clean and intuitive interface, allowing users to input lengthy URLs and receive shortened versions with minimal effort.​
<br>
*Real-Time Processing :* Leveraging React's state management and Vite's rapid development capabilities, the application provides immediate feedback, ensuring a seamless user experience.​

*Responsive Design:* The tool is optimized for various devices, ensuring accessibility and functionality across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.​

By deploying the application on **Netlify**, I benefit from features such as continuous deployment, global CDN distribution, and automated builds, ensuring high availability and performance.
