Price Tracker is a smart web application that helps users never miss a price change again. Simply paste a product link, and the app uses Firecrawl to intelligently scrape and extract key product data. All information is securely stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL), where the system continuously monitors price fluctuations. When a change is detected, users receive an instant email alert, allowing them to act at the perfect moment.

Why it matters
Online prices change constantly, and manually tracking them is time-consuming and inefficient. Price Tracker automates this process by monitoring products in real time and alerting users the moment prices change. This helps shoppers save money, make better purchasing decisions, and never miss a deal—without having to repeatedly check the same product pages.
